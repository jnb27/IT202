<h1> Welcome to the Double Or Nothing </h1>
<h2> Instructions </h2>
<p> This game is very simple, first you bet some coins, and then a coinflip will be done</p>
<p> As the user your only job is to pick one of the two buttons, which will be your guess. Is the next number generated higher or lower? If you get it right you earn coins, you are also able to roll again and double your payout.</p>
